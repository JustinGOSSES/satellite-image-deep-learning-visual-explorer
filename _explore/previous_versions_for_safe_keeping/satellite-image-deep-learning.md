# satellite-image-deep-learning
This page lists resources for performing deep learning on satellite imagery. To a lesser extent classical Machine learning (e.g. random forests) are also discussed, as are classical image processing techniques. Note there is a huge volume of academic literature published on these topics, and this repository does not seek to index them all but rather list approachable resources with published code that will benefit both the research *and* developer communities. If you find this work useful please give it a star and consider sponsoring it. You can also follow me on Twitter and LinkedIn below where I aim to post frequent updates on my new discoveries. I have also started a blog [here](https://github.com/robmarkcole/blog) and have published a post on the history of this repository called [Dissecting the satellite-image-deep-learning repo](https://robmarkcole.com/markdown/2022/07/24/satellite-image-deep-learning.html) Thanks for reading!

# Techniques
This section explores the different deep and machine learning (ML) techniques applied to common problems in satellite imagery analysis. Good background reading is [Deep learning in remote sensing applications: A meta-analysis and review](https://www.iges.or.jp/en/publication_documents/pub/peer/en/6898/Ma+et+al+2019.pdf)

## Classification
The classic cats vs dogs image classification task, which in the remote sensing domain is used to assign a label to an image, e.g. this is an image of a forest. The more complex case is applying multiple labels to an image. This approach of image level classification is not to be confused with pixel-level classification which is called semantic segmentation. In general, aerial images cover large geographical areas that include multiple classes of land, so treating this is as a classification problem is less common than using semantic segmentation. I recommend to get started with the EuroSAT dataset.

## Segmentation
 Segmentation will assign a class label to each **pixel** in an image. Segmentation is typically grouped into semantic, instance or panoptic segmentation. In semantic segmentation objects of the same class are assigned the same label, whilst in instance segmentation each object is assigned a unique label. Panoptic segmentation combines instance and semantic predictions. Read this [beginner’s guide to segmentation](https://medium.com/gsi-technology/a-beginners-guide-to-segmentation-in-satellite-images-9c00d2028d52). Single class models are often trained for road or building segmentation, with multi class for land use/crop type classification. Image annotation can take longer than for object detection since every pixel must be annotated. **Note** that many articles which refer to 'hyperspectral land classification' are actually describing semantic segmentation. Note that cloud detection can be addressed with semantic segmentation and has its own section [Cloud detection & removal](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning#cloud-detection--removal)

## Object detection
Several different techniques can be used to count the number of objects in an image. The returned data can be an object count (regression), a bounding box around individual objects in an image (typically using Yolo or Faster R-CNN architectures), a pixel mask for each object (instance segmentation), key points for an an object (such as wing tips, nose and tail of an aircraft), or simply a classification for a sliding tile over an image. A good introduction to the challenge of performing object detection on aerial imagery is given in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06042v2). In summary, images are large and objects may comprise only a few pixels, easily confused with random features in background. For the same reason, object detection datasets are inherently imbalanced, since the area of background typically dominates over the area of the objects to be detected. In general object detection performs well on large objects, and gets increasingly difficult as the objects get smaller & more densely packed. Model accuracy falls off rapidly as image resolution degrades, so it is common for object detection to use very high resolution imagery, e.g. 30cm RGB. A particular characteristic of aerial images is that objects can be oriented in any direction, so using rotated bounding boxes which aligning with the object can be crucial for extracting metrics such as the length and width of an object. Note that newer models such as Yolov5 may not achieve the same performance as 'older' models like Faster RCNN or Retinanet since they are no longer pre-trained on datasets such as ImageNet, but smaller datasets such as COCO dataset.

## Cloud detection & removal
Generally treated as a semantic segmentation problem or custom features created using band math
* See section [Kaggle - Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning#kaggle---understanding-clouds-from-satellite-images)
* From [this article on sentinelhub](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/improving-cloud-detection-with-machine-learning-c09dc5d7cf13) there are three popular classical algorithms that detects thresholds in multiple bands in order to identify clouds. In the same article they propose using semantic segmentation combined with a CNN for a cloud classifier (excellent review paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.06857.pdf)), but state that this requires too much compute resources.

## Super-resolution
Super-resolution attempts to enhance the resolution of an imaging system, and can be applied as a pre-processing step to improve the detection of small objects or boundaries. Its use is controversial since it can introduce artefacts at the same rate as real features. These techniques are generally grouped into single image super resolution (SISR) **or** a multi image super resolution (MISR)

In zero shot learning (ZSL) the model is assisted by the provision of auxiliary information which typically consists of descriptions/semantic attributes/word embeddings for both the seen and unseen classes at train time ([ref](https://learnopencv.com/zero-shot-learning-an-introduction/)). These approaches are particularly relevant to remote sensing, where there may be many examples of common classes, but few or even zero examples for other classes of interest.

## Self-supervised, unsupervised & contrastive learning
These techniques use unlabelled datasets. [Yann LeCun](https://braindump.jethro.dev/posts/lecun_cake_analogy/) has described self/unsupervised learning as the 'base of the cake': *If we think of our brain as a cake, then the cake base is unsupervised learning. The machine predicts any part of its input for any observed part, all without the use of labelled data. Supervised learning forms the icing on the cake, and reinforcement learning is the cherry on top.*

## Active learning
Supervised deep learning techniques typically require a huge number of annotated/labelled examples to provide a training dataset. However labelling at scale take significant time, expertise and resources. Active learning techniques aim to reduce the total amount of annotation that needs to be performed by selecting the most useful images to label from a large pool of unlabelled images, thus reducing the time to generate useful training datasets. These processes may be referred to as [Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning](https://medium.com/pytorch/https-medium-com-robert-munro-active-learning-with-pytorch-2f3ee8ebec)

## Image registration
Image registration is the process of registering one or more images onto another (typically well georeferenced) image. Traditionally this is performed manually by identifying control points (tie-points) in the images, for example using QGIS. This section lists approaches which mostly aim to automate this manual process. There is some overlap with the data fusion section but the distinction I make is that image registration is performed as a prerequisite to downstream processes which will use the registered data as an input.

* [Phase correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_correlation) is used to estimate the XY translation between two images with sub-pixel accuracy. Can be used for accurate registration of low resolution imagery onto high resolution imagery, or to register a [sub-image on a full image](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/registering-an-image-using-normalized-cross-correlation.html) -> Unlike many spatial-domain algorithms, the phase correlation method is resilient to noise, occlusions, and other defects.

## Neural nets in space
Processing on board a satellite allows less data to be downlinked. e.g. super-resolution image might take 8 images to generate, then a single image is downlinked. Other applications include cloud detection and collision avoidance.

# ML best practice
This section includes tips and ideas I have picked up from other practitioners including [ai-fast-track](https://github.com/ai-fast-track), [FraPochetti](https://github.com/FraPochetti) & the IceVision community
* Almost all imagery data on the internet is in RGB format, and common techniques designed for working with this 3 band imagery may fail or need significant adaptation to work with multiband data (e.g. 13-band Sentinel 2)
* In general, classification and object detection models are created using transfer learning, where the majority of the weights are not updated in training but have been pre computed using standard vision datasets such as ImageNet
* Since satellite images are typically very large, it is common to tile them before processing. Alternatively checkout [Fully Convolutional Image Classification on Arbitrary Sized Image](https://learnopencv.com/fully-convolutional-image-classification-on-arbitrary-sized-image/) -> TLDR replace the fully-connected layer with a convolution-layer
* Where you have small sample sizes, e.g. for a small object class which may be under represented in your training dataset, use image augmentation
* In general, larger models will outperform smaller models, particularly on challenging tasks such as detecting small objetcs
* If model performance in unsatisfactory, try to increase your dataset size before switching to another model architecture
* In training, whenever possible increase the batch size, as small batch sizes produce poor normalization statistics
* The vast majority of the literature uses supervised learning with the requirement for large volumes of annotated data, which is a bottleneck to development and deployment. We are just starting to see self-supervised approaches applied to remote sensing data
* [4-ways-to-improve-class-imbalance](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-ways-to-improve-class-imbalance-for-image-data-9adec8f390f1) discusses the pros and cons of several rebalancing techniques, applied to an aerial dataset. Reason to read: models can reach an accuracy ceiling where majority classes are easily predicted but minority classes poorly predicted. Overall model accuracy may not improve until steps are taken to account for class imbalance.

# Metrics
A number of metrics are common to all model types (but can have slightly different meanings in contexts such as object detection), whilst other metrics are very specific to particular classes of model. The correct choice of metric is particularly critical for imbalanced dataset problems, e.g. object detection
* TP = true positive, FP = false positive, TN = true negative, FN = false negative
* `Precision` is the % of correct positive predictions, calculated as `precision = TP/(TP+FP)`
* `Recall` or **true positive rate** (TPR), is the % of true positives captured by the model, calculated as `recall = TP/(TP+FN)`. Note that FN is not possible in object detection, so recall is not appropriate.
* The `F1 score` (also called the F-score or the F-measure) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as `F1 = 2*(precision * recall)/(precision + recall)`. It conveys the balance between the precision and the recall. [Ref](https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-accuracy-is-not-enough-more-performance-measures-you-can-use/)
* The **false positive rate** (FPR), calculated as `FPR = FP/(FP+TN)` is often plotted against recall/TPR in an [ROC curve](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc) which shows how the TPR/FPR tradeoff varies with classification threshold. Lowering the classification threshold returns more true positives, but also more false positives. Note that since FN is not possible in object detection, ROC curves are not appropriate.
* Precision-vs-recall curves visualise the tradeoff between making false positives and false negatives
* [Accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification) is the most commonly used metric in 'real life' but can be a highly misleading metric for imbalanced data sets.
* `IoU` is an object detection specific metric, being the average intersect over union of prediction and ground truth bounding boxes for a given confidence threshold
* `mAP@0.5` is another object detection specific metric, being the mean value of the average precision for each class. `@0.5` sets a threshold for how much of the predicted bounding box overlaps the ground truth bounding box, i.e. "minimum 50% overlap"
* For more comprehensive definitions checkout [Object-Detection-Metrics](https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/Object-Detection-Metrics)

# Synthetic data
Training data can be hard to acquire, particularly for rare events such as change detection after disasters, or imagery of rare classes of objects. In these situations, generating synthetic training data might be the only option. This has become quite sophisticated, with 3D models being use with open source games engines such as [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/).

# Free online compute
A GPU is required for training deep learning models (but not necessarily for inferencing), and this section lists a couple of free Jupyter environments with GPU available. There is a good overview of online Jupyter development environments [on the fastai site](https://course19.fast.ai). I personally use Colab Pro with data hosted on Google Drive, or Sagemaker if I have very long running training jobs.

## Google Colab
* Collaboratory [notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com) with GPU as a backend for free for 12 hours at a time. Note that the GPU may be shared with other users, so if you aren't getting good performance try reloading.
* Also a pro tier for $10 a month -> https://colab.research.google.com/signup
* Tensorflow, pytorch & fastai available but you may need to update them
* [Colab Alive](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colab-alive/eookkckfbbgnhdgcbfbicoahejkdoele?hl=en) is a chrome extension that keeps Colab notebooks alive.
* [colab-ssh](https://github.com/WassimBenzarti/colab-ssh) -> lets you ssh to a colab instance like it’s an EC2 machine and install packages that require full linux functionality

## Kaggle - also Google!
* Free to use
* GPU Kernels - may run for 1 hour
* Tensorflow, pytorch & fastai available but you may need to update them
* Advantage that many datasets are already available

## AWS SageMaker Studio Lab
* [SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/) is a recent release which competes with Google colab being free to use with no credit card or AWS account required
* [Github profile](https://github.com/topics/amazon-sagemaker-lab)

## Others
* [Paperspace gradient](https://gradient.run/notebooks) -> free tier includes GPU usage
* [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) -> many features for collaboration, GPU use is paid

# State of the art engineering
* Compute and data storage are on the cloud. Read how [Planet](https://cloud.google.com/customers/planet) and [Airbus](https://cloud.google.com/customers/airbus) use the cloud
* Traditional data formats aren't designed for processing on the cloud, so new standards are evolving such as [COG](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning#cloud-optimised-geotiff-cog) and [STAC](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning#spatiotemporal-asset-catalog-specification-stac)
* Google Earth Engine and Microsoft Planetary Computer are democratising access to 'planetary scale' compute
* Google Colab and others are providing free acces to GPU compute to enable training deep learning models
* No-code platforms and auto-ml are making ML techniques more accessible than ever
* Serverless compute (e.g. AWS Lambda) mean that managing servers may become a thing of the past
* Custom hardware is being developed for rapid training and inferencing with deep learning models, both in the datacenter and at the edge
* Supervised ML methods typically require large annotated datasets, but approaches such as self-supervised and active learning require less or even no annotation
* Computer vision traditionally delivered high performance image processing on a CPU by using compiled languages like C++, as used by OpenCV for example. The advent of GPUs are changing the paradigm, with alternatives optimised for GPU being created, such as [Kornia](https://kornia.github.io/)
* Whilst the combo of python and keras/tensorflow/pytorch are currently preeminent, new python libraries such as [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and alternative languages such as [Julia](https://julialang.org/) are showing serious promise

# Cloud providers
An overview of the most relevant services provided by AWS, Google and Microsoft. Also consider one of the many smaller but more specialised platorms such as [paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/)

## AWS
* Host your data on [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and metadata in a db such as [postgres](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
* For batch processing use [Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/). GPU instances are available for [batch deep learning](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/deep-learning-on-aws-batch/) inferencing. See how Rastervision implement this [here](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.13/cloudformation.html)
* If processing can be performed in 15 minutes or less, serverless [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions are an attractive option owing to their ability to scale. Note that lambda may not be a particularly quick solution for deep learning applications, since you do not have the option to batch inference on a GPU. Creating a docker container with all the required dependencies can be a challenge. To get started read [Using container images to run PyTorch models in AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/using-container-images-to-run-pytorch-models-in-aws-lambda/) and for an image classification example [checkout this repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lambda-docker-serverless-inference). Also read [Processing satellite imagery with serverless architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/processing-satellite-imagery-with-serverless-architecture/) which discusses queuing & lambda. Sagemaker also supports server less inference, see  [SageMaker Serverless Inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints.html). For managing a serverless infrastructure composed of multiple lambda functions use [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/index.html) and read [How to continuously deploy a FastAPI to AWS Lambda with AWS SAM](https://iwpnd.pw/articles/2020-01/deploy-fastapi-to-aws-lambda)
* [Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is an ecosystem of ML tools accessed via a hosted Jupyter environment & API. Read [Build GAN with PyTorch and Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-gan-with-pytorch-and-amazon-sagemaker/), [Run computer vision inference on large videos with Amazon SageMaker asynchronous endpoints](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/run-computer-vision-inference-on-large-videos-with-amazon-sagemaker-asynchronous-endpoints/)
* [SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/) competes with Google colab being free to use with no credit card or AWS account required
* [Deep learning AMIs](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/) are EC2 instances with deep learning frameworks preinstalled. They do require more setup from the user than Sagemaker but in return allow access to the underlying hardware, which makes debugging issues more straightforward. There is a [good guide to setting up your AMI instance on the Keras blog](https://blog.keras.io/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-gpu-on-aws-a-starter-guide.html). Read [Deploying the SpaceNet 6 Baseline on AWS](https://medium.com/the-downlinq/deploying-the-spacenet-6-baseline-on-aws-c811ad82da1)
* Specifically created for deep learning inferencing is [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/)
* [Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/) custom labels is a 'no code' annotation, training and inferencing service. Read [Training models using Satellite (Sentinel-2) imagery on Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels](https://ryfeus.medium.com/training-models-using-satellite-imagery-on-amazon-rekognition-custom-labels-dd44ac6a3812). For a comparison with Azure and Google alternatives [read this article](https://blog.roboflow.com/automl-vs-rekognition-vs-custom-vision/)
* Use [Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue) for data preprocessing - or use Sagemaker
* To orchestrate basic data pipelines use [Step functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/). Use the [AWS Step Functions Workflow Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-step-functions-workflow-studio-a-low-code-visual-tool-for-building-state-machines/) to get started. Read [Orchestrating and Monitoring Complex, Long-running Workflows Using AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/field-notes-orchestrating-and-monitoring-complex-long-running-workflows-using-aws-step-functions/) and checkout the [aws-step-functions-data-science-sdk-python](https://github.com/aws/aws-step-functions-data-science-sdk-python)
* If step functions are too limited or you want to write pipelines in python and use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for workflow management, checkout hosted [AWS managed Airflow](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow/). Read [Orchestrate XGBoost ML Pipelines with Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/orchestrate-xgboost-ml-pipelines-with-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow/) and checkout [amazon-mwaa-examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-mwaa-examples)
* When developing you will definitely want to use [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) and probably [aws-data-wrangler](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler)

# Deploying models
This section discusses how to get a trained machine learning & specifically deep learning model into production. For an overview on serving deep learning models checkout [Practical-Deep-Learning-on-the-Cloud](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/-Practical-Deep-Learning-on-the-Cloud). There are many options if you are happy to dedicate a server, although you may want a GPU for batch processing. For serverless use AWS lambda.

## Rest API on dedicated server
A common approach to serving up deep learning model inference code is to wrap it in a rest API. The API can be implemented in python (flask or FastAPI), and hosted on a dedicated server e.g. EC2 instance. Note that making this a scalable solution will require significant experience.
* Basic API: https://blog.keras.io/building-a-simple-keras-deep-learning-rest-api.html with code [here](https://github.com/jrosebr1/simple-keras-rest-api)
* Advanced API with request queuing: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/01/29/scalable-keras-deep-learning-rest-api/
* [How to make a geospatial Rest Api web service with Python, Flask and Shapely - Tutorial](https://hatarilabs.com/ih-en/how-to-make-a-geospatial-rest-api-web-service-with-python-flask-and-shapely-tutorial)
* [BMW-YOLOv4-Training-Automation](https://github.com/BMW-InnovationLab/BMW-YOLOv4-Training-Automation) -> project that demos training ML model via rest API

* [NI4OS-RSSC](https://github.com/risojevicv/NI4OS-RSSC) -> Web Service for Remote Sensing Scene Classification (RS2C) using TensorFlow Serving and Flask
* [Sat2Graph Inference Server](https://github.com/songtaohe/Sat2Graph/tree/master/docker) -> API in Go for road segmentation model inferencing
* [API algorithm to apply object detection model to terabyte size satellite images with 800% better performance and 8 times less resources usage](https://github.com/orhannurkan/API-algorithm-for-terabyte-size-images-)
* [clearcut_detection](https://github.com/QuantuMobileSoftware/clearcut_detection) -> django backend
* [airbus-ship-detection](https://github.com/jancervenka/airbus-ship-detection) -> CNN with REST API

## Framework specific model serving
If you are happy to live with some lock-in, these are good options:
* [Tensorflow serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) is limited to Tensorflow models
* [Pytorch serve](https://github.com/pytorch/serve) is easy to use, limited to Pytorch models, can be deployed via AWS Sagemaker
* [sagemaker-inference-toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-inference-toolkit) -> Serve machine learning models within a Docker container using AWS SageMaker

## Framework agnostic model serving
* The [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server) provides an optimized cloud and edge inferencing solution. Read [CAPE Analytics Uses Computer Vision to Put Geospatial Data and Risk Information in Hands of Property Insurance Companies](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/05/21/cape-analytics-computer-vision/)
* [RedisAI](https://oss.redis.com/redisai/) is a Redis module for executing Deep Learning/Machine Learning models and managing their data

## Using lambda functions - i.e. serverless
Using lambda functions allows inference without having to configure or manage the underlying infrastructure
* On AWS either use regular lambdas from AWS or [SageMaker Serverless Inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/serverless-endpoints.html)
* [Object detection inference with AWS Lambda and IceVision (PyTorch)](https://laurenzstrothmann.com/object-detection-inference-aws-lambda-icevision) with [repo](https://github.com/2649/laurenzstrothmann)
* [Deploying PyTorch on AWS Lambda](https://segments.ai/blog/pytorch-on-lambda)
* [Example deployment behind an API Gateway Proxy](https://github.com/philschmid/cdk-samples/tree/master/sagemaker-serverless-huggingface-endpoint)

## Models in the browser
The model is run in the browser itself on live images, ensuring processing is always with the latest model available and removing the requirement for dedicated server side inferencing
* [Classifying satellite imagery - Made with TensorFlow.js YoutTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zqjgeqc-ew)

## Model optimisation for deployment
The general approaches are outlined in [this article from NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/preparing-models-for-object-detection-with-real-and-synthetic-data-and-tao-toolkit/) which discusses fine tuning a model pre-trained on synthetic data (Rareplanes) with 10% real data, then pruning the model to reduce its size, before quantizing the model to improve inference speed. There are also toolkits for optimisation, in particular [ONNX](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) which is framework agnostic.

## MLOps
[MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps) is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently.
* [How to Build MLOps Pipelines with GitHub Actions](https://neptune.ai/blog/build-mlops-pipelines-with-github-actions-guide/)

## Model monitoring
Once your model is deployed you will want to monitor for data errors, broken pipelines, and model performance degradation/drift [ref](https://towardsdatascience.com/deploy-and-monitor-your-ml-application-with-flask-and-whylabs-4cd1e757c94b)

# Image annotation
For supervised machine learning, you will require annotated images. For example if you are performing object detection you will need to annotate images with bounding boxes. Check that your annotation tool of choice supports large image (likely geotiff) files, as not all will. Note that GeoJSON is widely used by remote sensing researchers but this annotation format is not commonly supported in general computer vision frameworks, and in practice you may have to convert the annotation format to use the data with your chosen framework. There are both closed and open source tools for creating and converting annotation formats. Some of these tools are simply for performing annotation, whilst others add features such as dataset management and versioning. Note that self-supervised and active learning approaches might circumvent the need to perform a large scale annotation exercise. Note that tiffs/geotiffs cannot be displayed by most browsers (Chrome), but CAN render in Safari.
